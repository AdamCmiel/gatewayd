## Gateway API Server

This software is a database-backed web server that serves as a
back end for Ripple Gateway applications. A HTTP/JSON server, Javascript library, and CLI are provided as interfaces to a deployed gateway.

The Ripple Gateway's features include: 
  - user registration 
  - deposits and withdrawals
  - issuing currency
  - ripple payment sending and monitoring
  - gateway administration

## Installation

The gateway server software requires git, g++, make, nodejs, postgres, and several npm modules.

- Compresensive [installation script](./doc/install.md) for Ubuntu

## Setup

Once ripple-gateway is installed, [configure your gateway](./doc/setup.md) wallets and server


## Running the Ripple Gateway

After installation, start the gateway processes by running the command:

    bin/gateway start

## Ripple Gateway Processes

The Ripple Gateway software is composed of a backed data store which serves as a queue for many types of processes that handle deposits and withdrawals of assets, and issuance and receipt of digital currency on ripple. In this post I will explain the various processes of a ripple gateway that together form an automated machine of gateway transaction processing. 

![Ripple Gateway Process Diagram](https://s3.amazonaws.com/imagesz/ripple_gateway_diagram.jpg)

In the diagram above each process is represented by a circle, and should be designed to scale horizontally, that is enable N processes of each type all operating on the same queues. Queues, represented by rectangles are actually SQL database tables maintained by the gateway data store.

## Process Flow of a Gateway Deposit

- Process 1: Recording Deposits

A banking API integration or manual human gateway operator receives the deposit of an asset and records the deposit in the ripple gateway data store. This process is designed to be implemented externally, and example implementations are provided by the command line interface and the http/json express.js server.

API calls: record_deposit

- Process 2: Deposit Business Logic
    
A newly recorded deposit is handed to the business logic, which performs some function, ultimately en-queuing a corresponding ripple payment. This process is designed to be modified and customized.

    node processes/deposits.js

API calls: list_deposits, enqueue_payment

-  Process 3: Send Outgoing Ripple Payments

A payment record resulting from the deposit business logic process is sent to the Ripple REST server, ultimately propagating to the network. This process is standard and should not be modified.

    node processes/outgoing.js

API calls: send_payment

## Process Flow of a Gateway Withdrawal

- Process 1: Record inbound Ripple payments

Poll the Ripple REST server for new payment notifications to the gateway, and record the incoming payments in the ripple gateway data store. This process is standard and should not be modified.

    node processes/incoming.js

API calls: get_payment_notification, record_payment

- Process 2: Withdrawal Business Logic

A newly recorded incoming ripple payment is handed to the business logic, which performs some function, ultimately en-queuing a corresponding asset withdrawal record. This process is designed to be modified and customized.

    node processes/withdrawals.js

API calls: enqueue_withdrawal

- Process 3: Clear Withdrawals

A banking API integration or manual human gateway operator reads the queue of pending withdrawals from the gateway data store, redeems the corresponding asset, and finally clears the withdrawal from the queue by updating the gateway data store. This process is designed to be implemented externally, and example implementations are provided by the command line interface and the http/json express.js server.

API calls: list_withdrawals, clear_withdrawal

## HTTP/JSON Server Core Interface

  - A Basic Auth strategy is used for authentication of users, admin.
  - Important NPM modules include: passport, db-migrate, sequelize, ripple-lib, pg, nconf, commander, bignumber.js, validator, and mocha

2. Postgres
  - The easiest way to get started with Postgres is by launching a [free database hosted by Heroku](https://postgres.heroku.com/databases)
  - For local development on Mac the simplest installation is via the [Postgres App](http://postgresapp.com/) by Heroku.
  - On Ubuntu, [install and configure Postgres](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PostgreSQL) using the aptitude package manager and the psql tool.

3. [Ripple REST API](https://github.com/ripple/ripple-rest.git)
  - The Ripple REST API provides a simplified HTTP/JSON interface to all the Ripple protocol network operations, such as payments and other transactions.
